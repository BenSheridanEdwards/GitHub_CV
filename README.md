## <a name="Introduction">Introduction</a>

I am a software developer that throws himself at new challenges with boundless enthusiasm and a fearless sense of determination. I'm naturally great at analysing problems and finding creative solutions. For the past 4 years in a recruitment role, I've leapt outside of my comfort zone on a daily basis to become an exceptional communicator, attentive mentor, and leader of teams.

One year ago, I began recruiting Software Engineers for companies across Europe and found myself quickly empathic to developers who weren't passing London's high bar for technical tests. So I jumped into coding myself, in an attempt to better understand the tests I was giving my candidates, and give them more insightful feedback.

My love for coding was immediate and instantly became an obsessive passion of mine. After 6 months of daily practice, I applied and was accepted into Maker's Academy, and have since graduated in February 2020. Now I'm ready to dive into my first role as a Software Developer, with a company whose vision I believe in, and can help me grow.

## Soft Skills

#### Insatiably curious
-  I've always strived to expand my mind by gaining knowledge and experience from a wide variety of sources. I'm a voracious reader  and listener of books and have logged over 1000 hours of listening time on Audible. I believe reading widely allows you to build realistic mental models for navigating the world and make more informed decisions about how to approach life. I read books on everything from Technology, Business, Finance, Psychology, to Philosophy and Spirituality.

#### Determined
- Since starting strength training at the age of 16, I've developed discipline and focus that has spilled over in many areas of my life. Including choosing the right foods to optimise my health, consistency in learning, and focus on long-term goals over short-term gratification.

#### Clear and effective communicator
- For the past 4 years in recruitment roles, I've learned to read social situations, tap into my emotional intelligence, and communicate clearly and effectively.
- As a natural introvert, I found being in this type of role to be the most challenging and rewarding experience of my life so far and turned communication from a weakness into a strength.
